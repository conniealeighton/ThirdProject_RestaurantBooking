CodeClan Week-long Group Project 3 - Java Restaurant App has a ReactJS front-end, using React JavaScript, embedded HTML, and CSS.  It uses React Components, React-DOM, MomentJS, and React-Bootstrap.  It was originally created using Create-React-App, built in Atom, and displayed on localhost:3000.  It uses a proxy to access a back-end built in IntelliJ using Spring.  It is a restaurant booking system which enables employees to take phone bookings, track customers and their bookings, create new customers and bookings and edit both of them as well.
